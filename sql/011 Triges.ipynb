    "### **TRIGGERS**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition:**  \n",
    "A **trigger** in SQL is a special type of stored procedure that automatically executes (or \"fires\") when certain events occur in a database. Triggers are used to maintain data integrity, enforce business rules, and automate system processes. They are tied to specific tables and are activated by data modifications such as `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Triggers can be defined to execute before or after the event occurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Types of Triggers:**\n",
    "1. **BEFORE Trigger:**  \n",
    "   A **BEFORE trigger** is fired before an `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE` operation is executed on a table.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **AFTER Trigger:**  \n",
    "   An **AFTER trigger** is fired after an `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE` operation is executed on a table.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **INSTEAD OF Trigger:**  \n",
    "   An **INSTEAD OF trigger** is fired instead of an `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE` operation. This allows you to replace the usual action with custom behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Syntax for Creating a Trigger:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CREATE TRIGGER trigger_name\n",
    "{BEFORE | AFTER | INSTEAD OF} \n",
    "{INSERT | UPDATE | DELETE} ON table_name\n",
    "FOR EACH ROW\n",
    "BEGIN\n",
    "  -- trigger logic (SQL statements)\n",
    "END;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- `trigger_name`: The name of the trigger.\n",
    "- `BEFORE | AFTER | INSTEAD OF`: Specifies when the trigger should fire.\n",
    "- `INSERT | UPDATE | DELETE`: The event that fires the trigger.\n",
    "- `table_name`: The table on which the trigger is defined.\n",
    "- `FOR EACH ROW`: The trigger will execute for each affected row.\n",
    "- `BEGIN ... END`: The block containing the logic for the trigger.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Example using the Student Database:**\n",
    "\n",
    "We will create a **trigger** to automatically log the time when a student enrolls in a course.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Creating a Trigger to Track Enrollments:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s assume we want to automatically insert a record into an `AuditLog` table every time a student enrolls in a course.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Schema for `AuditLog`:\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CREATE TABLE AuditLog (\n",
    "  LogID INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,\n",
    "  Action VARCHAR(50),\n",
    "  StudentID INT,\n",
    "  CourseID INT,\n",
    "  Timestamp DATETIME\n",
    ");\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Creating the Trigger:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let’s create a trigger that will automatically insert a log into the `AuditLog` table after a new record is added to the `Enrollments` table.\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CREATE TRIGGER TrackEnrollment\n",
    "AFTER INSERT ON Enrollments\n",
    "FOR EACH ROW\n",
    "BEGIN\n",
    "  INSERT INTO AuditLog (Action, StudentID, CourseID, Timestamp)\n",
    "  VALUES ('ENROLL', NEW.StudentID, NEW.CourseID, NOW());\n",
    "END;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Explanation:\n",
    "- `AFTER INSERT ON Enrollments`: This means the trigger will fire after a new record is inserted into the `Enrollments` table.\n",
    "- `NEW.StudentID` and `NEW.CourseID`: The `NEW` keyword refers to the new row that was inserted into the `Enrollments` table. We use this to access the `StudentID` and `CourseID` values from the newly inserted record.\n",
    "- `NOW()`: This function provides the current timestamp for when the enrollment occurred.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Inserting Data to Trigger the Action:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, if a student enrolls in a course, the trigger will fire and insert a record into the `AuditLog` table.\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "INSERT INTO Enrollments (EnrollmentID, StudentID, CourseID, EnrollmentDate)\n",
    "VALUES (1, 1, 1, '2024-01-15');\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Viewing the `AuditLog` Table:**\n",
    "\n",
    "You can now view the `AuditLog` table to see the automatically inserted record:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT * FROM AuditLog;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output:**\n",
    "\n",
    "| LogID | Action  | StudentID | CourseID | Timestamp           |\n",
    "|-------|---------|-----------|----------|---------------------|\n",
    "| 1     | ENROLL  | 1         | 1        | 2024-01-15 12:30:00 |\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Example of a BEFORE Trigger:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s say we want to ensure that a student's age is at least 18 before they can enroll in a course. We can create a **BEFORE INSERT trigger** on the `Enrollments` table to check the student's age.\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CREATE TRIGGER CheckStudentAge\n",
    "BEFORE INSERT ON Enrollments\n",
    "FOR EACH ROW\n",
    "BEGIN\n",
    "  DECLARE student_age INT;\n",
    "  -- Get the age of the student\n",
    "  SELECT Age INTO student_age\n",
    "  FROM Students\n",
    "  WHERE StudentID = NEW.StudentID;\n",
    "  \n",
    "  -- Check if the student is under 18\n",
    "  IF student_age < 18 THEN\n",
    "    SIGNAL SQLSTATE '45000'\n",
    "    SET MESSAGE_TEXT = 'Student must be at least 18 years old to enroll.';\n",
    "  END IF;\n",
    "END;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Explanation:\n",
    "- `BEFORE INSERT ON Enrollments`: The trigger fires before a new enrollment is inserted.\n",
    "- `SELECT Age INTO student_age`: This retrieves the age of the student who is trying to enroll.\n",
    "- The `IF` condition checks if the student's age is less than 18. If so, it raises an error using `SIGNAL SQLSTATE '45000'`.\n",
    "\n",
    "If a student under 18 tries to enroll, the trigger will prevent the insertion and return an error message.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Dropping a Trigger:**\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to remove a trigger, you can use the `DROP TRIGGER` statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "DROP TRIGGER TrackEnrollment;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Use Cases for Triggers:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Integrity:**  \n",
    "   Triggers can be used to ensure data consistency and integrity. For example, enforcing that the data adheres to certain business rules (e.g., age restrictions for courses).\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Auditing:**  \n",
    "   Triggers are often used to maintain audit logs for data modifications, tracking who performed actions and when.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Automatic Calculations:**  \n",
    "   You can use triggers to automatically calculate values or update other tables when certain actions occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Complex Validation:**  \n",
    "   Triggers can help automate complex validations that go beyond what constraints can handle.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Summary of Triggers:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Triggers** automate actions in the database in response to certain events like `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE`.\n",
    "- **Types of Triggers:**\n",
    "  - `BEFORE`: Fired before the data modification.\n",
    "  - `AFTER`: Fired after the data modification.\n",
    "  - `INSTEAD OF`: Replaces the data modification action with custom logic.\n",
    "- **Use Cases:** Data integrity enforcement, auditing, automatic calculations, and complex validation.\n",
