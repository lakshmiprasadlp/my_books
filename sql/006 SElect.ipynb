    "### **SELECT Statement in SQL**  \n",
    "\n",
    "The `SELECT` statement is the most commonly used SQL command to retrieve data from a database. It allows you to fetch data from one or more tables, perform calculations, apply conditions, and organize the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Syntax**:  \n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT column1, column2, ...\n",
    "FROM table_name\n",
    "[WHERE condition]\n",
    "[GROUP BY column1, column2, ...]\n",
    "[HAVING condition]\n",
    "[ORDER BY column1 [ASC|DESC]];\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Components of SELECT**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`SELECT`**: Specifies the columns to retrieve.\n",
    "2. **`FROM`**: Specifies the table to retrieve data from.\n",
    "3. **`WHERE`**: Filters rows based on a condition.\n",
    "4. **`GROUP BY`**: Groups rows that have the same values in specified columns.\n",
    "5. **`HAVING`**: Filters grouped data.\n",
    "6. **`ORDER BY`**: Specifies the order of the result set.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. Basic SELECT Query**  \n",
    "Fetch all columns from a table.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Example**:  \n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT * \n",
    "FROM Students;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This retrieves all rows and columns from the `Students` table.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Selecting Specific Columns**  \n",
    "Fetch specific columns.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Example**:  \n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT Name, Age \n",
    "FROM Students;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This retrieves the `Name` and `Age` columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. Using WHERE Clause**  \n",
    "Filters rows based on a condition.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Example**:  \n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT Name, Age \n",
    "FROM Students \n",
    "WHERE Age > 20;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This retrieves students older than 20.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4. Using Logical Operators (`AND`, `OR`, `NOT`)**  \n",
    "Combine multiple conditions.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Example**:  \n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT Name, City \n",
    "FROM Students \n",
    "WHERE Age > 20 AND City = 'Miami';\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This retrieves students older than 20 and living in Miami.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **5. Using Aggregate Functions (`SUM`, `AVG`, `COUNT`, `MAX`, `MIN`)**  \n",
    "Perform calculations on columns.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Example**:  \n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT COUNT(StudentID) AS TotalStudents, AVG(Age) AS AverageAge \n",
    "FROM Students;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This calculates the total number of students and their average age.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **6. GROUP BY Clause**  \n",
    "Group rows with the same values in specified columns.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Example**:  \n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT City, COUNT(StudentID) AS StudentsInCity \n",
    "FROM Students \n",
    "GROUP BY City;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This counts the number of students in each city.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **7. HAVING Clause**  \n",
    "Filters grouped data.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Example**:  \n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT City, COUNT(StudentID) AS StudentsInCity \n",
    "FROM Students \n",
    "GROUP BY City \n",
    "HAVING COUNT(StudentID) > 5;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This retrieves cities with more than 5 students.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **8. ORDER BY Clause**  \n",
    "Sorts the result set in ascending or descending order.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Example**:  \n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT Name, Age \n",
    "FROM Students \n",
    "ORDER BY Age DESC;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT Name AS StudentName, Age AS StudentAge \n",
    "FROM Students;\n",
    "```\n",

    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT Name, Age + 1 AS AgeNextYear \n",
    "FROM Students;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This adds 1 to the `Age` column for each student.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "### **Example Database: Students**\n",
    "\n",
    "| **StudentID** | **Name**  | **Age** | **City**   | **Grade** |\n",
