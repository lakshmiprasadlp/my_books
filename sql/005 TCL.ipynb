    "### **TCL (Transaction Control Language)**  \n",
    "\n",
    "TCL commands manage transactions in a database. A transaction is a sequence of SQL operations that are executed as a single unit, ensuring data integrity. The most common TCL commands are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **COMMIT**: Saves all the changes made during the current transaction.  \n",
    "2. **ROLLBACK**: Reverts changes made during the current transaction.  \n",
    "3. **SAVEPOINT**: Sets a point within a transaction to which you can later roll back.  \n",
    "4. **SET TRANSACTION**: Defines properties for the current transaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. COMMIT**  \n",
    "Saves all the changes made by DML statements during the transaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Syntax**:  \n",
    "```sql\n",
    "COMMIT;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Example**:  \n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "BEGIN TRANSACTION;\n",
    "\n",
    "INSERT INTO Students (StudentID, Name, Age, City)\n",
    "VALUES (5, 'Eve', 23, 'Miami');\n",
    "\n",
    "UPDATE Students\n",
    "SET Age = 24\n",
    "WHERE Name = 'Eve';\n",
    "\n",
    "COMMIT;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "After `COMMIT`, all changes are permanently saved to the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. ROLLBACK**  \n",
    "Undoes changes made during the current transaction before a `COMMIT` is issued.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Syntax**:  \n",
    "```sql\n",
    "ROLLBACK;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Example**:  \n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "BEGIN TRANSACTION;\n",
    "\n",
    "DELETE FROM Students\n",
    "WHERE Name = 'Alice';\n",
    "\n",
    "-- An error occurs or a decision is made to cancel the operation\n",
    "ROLLBACK;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "After `ROLLBACK`, the deletion of Alice's record is undone.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. SAVEPOINT**  \n",
    "Sets a save point within a transaction, allowing partial rollbacks to that specific point.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Syntax**:  \n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SAVEPOINT savepoint_name;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Example**:  \n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "BEGIN TRANSACTION;\n",
    "\n",
    "INSERT INTO Students (StudentID, Name, Age, City)\n",
    "VALUES (6, 'Frank', 21, 'Dallas');\n",
    "\n",
    "SAVEPOINT Savepoint1;\n",
    "\n",
    "UPDATE Students\n",
    "SET City = 'Austin'\n",
    "WHERE Name = 'Frank';\n",
    "\n",
    "ROLLBACK TO Savepoint1;\n",
    "\n",
    "COMMIT;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, the update to change Frank's city to `Austin` is undone, but the insertion of Frank is saved because of the rollback to `Savepoint1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4. SET TRANSACTION**  \n",
    "Defines the properties of a transaction, such as its isolation level.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Syntax**:  \n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SET TRANSACTION [READ WRITE | READ ONLY] [ISOLATION LEVEL isolation_level];\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Example**:  \n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SET TRANSACTION READ WRITE ISOLATION LEVEL SERIALIZABLE;\n",
    "\n",
    "BEGIN TRANSACTION;\n",
    "\n",
    "INSERT INTO Students (StudentID, Name, Age, City)\n",
    "VALUES (7, 'Grace', 22, 'Houston');\n",
    "\n",
    "COMMIT;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Key Points**  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Transactions**: A transaction begins with a `BEGIN TRANSACTION` (or starts implicitly) and ends with a `COMMIT` or `ROLLBACK`.  \n",
    "2. **Atomicity**: Transactions ensure that all operations are completed successfully, or none of them are applied.  \n",
    "3. **SAVEPOINT Advantage**: Useful for dividing large transactions into smaller, manageable parts.  \n",
    "4. **Isolation Levels**: Ensure consistency when multiple transactions occur concurrently.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let me know if you'd like more examples or detailed use cases!"
