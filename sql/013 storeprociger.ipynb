    "### **Stored Procedures**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition:**  \n",
    "A **stored procedure** is a precompiled collection of one or more SQL statements that can be executed as a unit. They are stored in the database and can be invoked by the user or an application. Stored procedures help in encapsulating complex SQL logic, improving performance, and ensuring security by limiting direct access to underlying tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Benefits of Stored Procedures:**\n",
    "1. **Performance:** Stored procedures are precompiled, so they generally execute faster than dynamic SQL.\n",
    "2. **Security:** They can encapsulate business logic, and access to underlying tables can be restricted.\n",
    "3. **Reusability:** Once created, stored procedures can be reused multiple times.\n",
    "4. **Maintainability:** Changes can be made in one place (the procedure) rather than updating all queries in your application code.\n",
    "5. **Reduced Network Traffic:** Stored procedures reduce the number of calls from the application to the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Syntax for Creating a Stored Procedure:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CREATE PROCEDURE procedure_name\n",
    "[parameter1 datatype, parameter2 datatype, ...]\n",
    "AS\n",
    "BEGIN\n",
    "    -- SQL statements\n",
    "    SELECT * FROM table_name;\n",
    "    -- Other logic (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, etc.)\n",
    "END;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **procedure_name**: The name of the stored procedure.\n",
    "- **parameters**: Optional parameters that can be passed to the procedure.\n",
    "- **SQL statements**: The SQL logic (queries, data manipulation) that the procedure will execute.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we want to create a stored procedure that retrieves a student's information based on their `StudentID` from the `Students` table.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **Create a Stored Procedure to Fetch Student Details:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CREATE PROCEDURE GetStudentDetails(IN student_id INT)\n",
    "BEGIN\n",
    "    SELECT * FROM Students\n",
    "    WHERE StudentID = student_id;\n",
    "END;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- `IN student_id INT`: The parameter `student_id` is passed as input to the procedure.\n",
    "- The `SELECT` query retrieves the student's details based on the provided `StudentID`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **Calling the Stored Procedure:**\n",
    "\n",
    "To call the stored procedure, you would use the `CALL` statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CALL GetStudentDetails(1);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will return the details of the student with `StudentID = 1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. **Stored Procedure with Multiple SQL Statements:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Stored procedures can include multiple SQL statements. For example, let's create a stored procedure that retrieves the studentâ€™s details and also calculates the total number of courses the student is enrolled in.\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CREATE PROCEDURE GetStudentWithCourses(IN student_id INT)\n",
    "BEGIN\n",
    "    -- Get student details\n",
    "    SELECT * FROM Students\n",
    "    WHERE StudentID = student_id;\n",
    "    \n",
    "    -- Get total number of courses the student is enrolled in\n",
    "    SELECT COUNT(*) AS TotalCourses\n",
    "    FROM Enrollments\n",
    "    WHERE StudentID = student_id;\n",
    "END;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To call this procedure:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CALL GetStudentWithCourses(1);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example Result:\n",
    "| StudentID | Name    | Age | Gender | City      |\n",
    "|-----------|---------|-----|--------|-----------|\n",
    "| 1         | Alice   | 20  | Female | New York  |\n",
    "\n",
    "| TotalCourses |\n",
    "|--------------|\n",
    "| 3            |\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Stored Procedure with Output Parameters:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Stored procedures can return values through output parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. **Stored Procedure with Output Parameters:**\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let's create a procedure that updates a student's grade and returns the updated grade as an output parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CREATE PROCEDURE UpdateGrade(\n",
    "    IN student_id INT, \n",
    "    IN course_id INT, \n",
    "    IN new_grade VARCHAR(2),\n",
    "    OUT updated_grade VARCHAR(2)\n",
    ")\n",
    "BEGIN\n",
    "    -- Update grade\n",
    "    UPDATE Grades\n",
    "    SET Grade = new_grade\n",
    "    WHERE EnrollmentID IN (\n",
    "        SELECT EnrollmentID\n",
    "        FROM Enrollments\n",
    "        WHERE StudentID = student_id AND CourseID = course_id\n",
    "    );\n",
    "\n",
    "    -- Get the updated grade\n",
    "    SELECT Grade INTO updated_grade\n",
    "    FROM Grades\n",
    "    WHERE EnrollmentID IN (\n",
    "        SELECT EnrollmentID\n",
    "        FROM Enrollments\n",
    "        WHERE StudentID = student_id AND CourseID = course_id\n",
    "    );\n",
    "END;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Explanation:\n",
    "- `IN` parameters are used to input values into the procedure.\n",
    "- `OUT` parameters are used to return values from the procedure.\n",
    "- The procedure updates the grade and also returns the updated grade to the caller.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. **Calling a Stored Procedure with Output Parameter:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CALL UpdateGrade(1, 101, 'A', @grade);\n",
    "SELECT @grade AS UpdatedGrade;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, `@grade` is a variable that will hold the output of the procedure.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Modifying a Stored Procedure:**\n",
    "\n",
    "If you need to modify a stored procedure, you can drop and recreate it, or use an `ALTER PROCEDURE` if the database supports it.\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "DROP PROCEDURE IF EXISTS GetStudentDetails;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Deleting a Stored Procedure:**\n",
    "\n",
    "To delete a stored procedure, use the `DROP PROCEDURE` command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "DROP PROCEDURE GetStudentDetails;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Summary of Key Concepts:**\n",
    "- **CREATE PROCEDURE**: Used to create a stored procedure.\n",
    "- **IN, OUT, INOUT**: Parameters that define input, output, and both input/output parameters.\n",
    "- **BEGIN ... END**: Denotes the block of SQL statements that form the body of the procedure.\n",
    "- **CALL**: Used to execute a stored procedure.\n",
    "- **DROP PROCEDURE**: Used to delete a stored procedure.\n",
