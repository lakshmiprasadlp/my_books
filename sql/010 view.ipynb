    "### VIEWS\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition:**  \n",
    "A **view** in SQL is a virtual table that consists of a stored query result. It does not store data physically but instead provides a way to simplify complex queries, aggregate data, or combine data from multiple tables. You can think of it as a saved SELECT query that can be referenced like a regular table.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Syntax to Create a View:**\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CREATE VIEW view_name AS\n",
    "SELECT column1, column2, ...\n",
    "FROM table_name\n",
    "WHERE condition;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Syntax to Query a View:**\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT * FROM view_name;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Syntax to Drop a View:**\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "DROP VIEW view_name;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example using the **Student Database**:\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use the following tables:\n",
    "- `Students`\n",
    "- `Courses`\n",
    "- `Enrollments`\n",
    "- `Grades`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Create a View: **Student_Course_Enrollments**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal:** Create a view that combines students, their courses, and enrollment information.\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CREATE VIEW Student_Course_Enrollments AS\n",
    "SELECT Students.Name AS StudentName, Courses.CourseName, Enrollments.EnrollmentDate\n",
    "FROM Students\n",
    "INNER JOIN Enrollments ON Students.StudentID = Enrollments.StudentID\n",
    "INNER JOIN Courses ON Enrollments.CourseID = Courses.CourseID;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Query the View:\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you can query this view like a regular table:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT * FROM Student_Course_Enrollments;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output:**  \n",
    "| StudentName | CourseName   | EnrollmentDate |\n",
    "|-------------|--------------|----------------|\n",
    "| Alice       | Math 101     | 2024-01-15     |\n",
    "| Bob         | Science 101  | 2024-01-20     |\n",
    "| Charlie     | Math 101     | 2024-02-10     |\n",
    "| Diana       | History 101  | 2024-03-05     |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Modify Data in a View:\n",
    "\n",
    "You cannot directly modify data in a view that involves complex joins, aggregations, or non-updateable queries. However, if the view is based on a single table, you can update the underlying data through the view.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Drop a View:\n",
    "\n",
    "To remove the view, you can use the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "DROP VIEW Student_Course_Enrollments;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use Case:\n",
    "\n",
    "Views are particularly useful when you frequently need to perform complex queries or when you want to simplify your SQL code. For example:\n",
    "- Simplifying complex joins and subqueries.\n",
    "- Providing an abstraction layer for users who need only a subset of data without exposing the underlying tables.\n",
    "- Creating security or data access layers by restricting which columns or rows can be queried.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Let me know if you'd like to explore more about views or move to the next topic!"
