    "### **CONSTRAINTS**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition:**  \n",
    "A **constraint** in SQL is a rule that limits the type of data that can be inserted into a table. Constraints are used to enforce the integrity of the data in the database. They ensure that the data is accurate, valid, and consistent.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Types of Constraints:**\n",
    "1. **PRIMARY KEY**\n",
    "2. **FOREIGN KEY**\n",
    "3. **UNIQUE**\n",
    "4. **NOT NULL**\n",
    "5. **CHECK**\n",
    "6. **DEFAULT**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **PRIMARY KEY**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition:**  \n",
    "A **PRIMARY KEY** constraint uniquely identifies each record in a database table. A table can have only one primary key, and it must contain unique values. The primary key column cannot have `NULL` values.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Characteristics of a PRIMARY KEY:**\n",
    "- Uniqueness: No two rows can have the same value in the primary key column(s).\n",
    "- Non-NULL: The primary key column(s) must always contain values.\n",
    "- Each table can have only one primary key, which can be a single or a combination of columns (composite primary key).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Syntax to Create a Primary Key:**\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CREATE TABLE table_name (\n",
    "  column_name datatype,\n",
    "  ...\n",
    "  CONSTRAINT constraint_name PRIMARY KEY (column_name);\n",
    ");\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example using the **Student Database**:**\n",
    "\n",
    "In our **Students** table, we can define `StudentID` as the primary key.\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CREATE TABLE Students (\n",
    "  StudentID INT,\n",
    "  Name VARCHAR(50),\n",
    "  Age INT,\n",
    "  Gender CHAR(1),\n",
    "  City VARCHAR(50),\n",
    "  CONSTRAINT PK_Student PRIMARY KEY (StudentID)\n",
    ");\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**  \n",
    "- `StudentID` is the primary key, and each student will have a unique `StudentID`.\n",
    "- We cannot insert two students with the same `StudentID` or leave the `StudentID` column as `NULL`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Inserting Data into the Students Table:**\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "INSERT INTO Students (StudentID, Name, Age, Gender, City)\n",
    "VALUES (1, 'Alice', 21, 'F', 'Dallas');\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you attempt to insert a record with a duplicate `StudentID`, SQL will return an error.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **FOREIGN KEY**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition:**  \n",
    "A **FOREIGN KEY** is a column (or a set of columns) in one table that references the **PRIMARY KEY** or **UNIQUE KEY** of another table. The foreign key constraint ensures that the value in the foreign key column matches an existing value in the referenced table, ensuring referential integrity between the two tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Characteristics of a FOREIGN KEY:**\n",
    "- Ensures that a value in the foreign key column corresponds to an existing value in the referenced table.\n",
    "- A foreign key can accept `NULL` values unless explicitly restricted.\n",
    "- Foreign keys are used to establish relationships between tables (e.g., one-to-many, many-to-many).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Syntax to Create a Foreign Key:**\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CREATE TABLE table_name (\n",
    "  column_name datatype,\n",
    "  ...\n",
    "  CONSTRAINT constraint_name FOREIGN KEY (column_name) REFERENCES referenced_table(referenced_column)\n",
    ");\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example using the **Student Database**:**\n",
    "\n",
    "In the **Enrollments** table, `StudentID` is a foreign key that references the `StudentID` column in the `Students` table, and `CourseID` is a foreign key that references the `CourseID` column in the `Courses` table.\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CREATE TABLE Enrollments (\n",
    "  EnrollmentID INT,\n",
    "  StudentID INT,\n",
    "  CourseID INT,\n",
    "  EnrollmentDate DATE,\n",
    "  CONSTRAINT PK_Enrollment PRIMARY KEY (EnrollmentID),\n",
    "  CONSTRAINT FK_Student FOREIGN KEY (StudentID) REFERENCES Students(StudentID),\n",
    "  CONSTRAINT FK_Course FOREIGN KEY (CourseID) REFERENCES Courses(CourseID)\n",
    ");\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "- `StudentID` in the `Enrollments` table is a foreign key referencing `StudentID` in the `Students` table.\n",
    "- `CourseID` in the `Enrollments` table is a foreign key referencing `CourseID` in the `Courses` table.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Foreign Key Operations:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **ON DELETE CASCADE:** When a referenced record in the parent table is deleted, all corresponding records in the child table are automatically deleted.\n",
    "   ```sql\n",
    "   CONSTRAINT FK_Student FOREIGN KEY (StudentID) \n",
    "   REFERENCES Students(StudentID)\n",
    "   ON DELETE CASCADE;\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **ON UPDATE CASCADE:** When a referenced record in the parent table is updated, the corresponding foreign key values in the child table are also updated automatically.\n",
    "   ```sql\n",
    "   CONSTRAINT FK_Student FOREIGN KEY (StudentID)\n",
    "   REFERENCES Students(StudentID)\n",
    "   ON UPDATE CASCADE;\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **ON DELETE SET NULL:** When a referenced record is deleted, the foreign key in the child table is set to `NULL`.\n",
    "   ```sql\n",
    "   CONSTRAINT FK_Student FOREIGN KEY (StudentID)\n",
    "   REFERENCES Students(StudentID)\n",
    "   ON DELETE SET NULL;\n",

    "1. **Insert a student into the `Students` table:**\n",

    "   INSERT INTO Students (StudentID, Name, Age, Gender, City)\n",
    "   VALUES (1, 'Alice', 21, 'F', 'Dallas');\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Insert a course into the `Courses` table:**\n",

    "   INSERT INTO Courses (CourseID, CourseName, Credits)\n",
    "   VALUES (1, 'Math 101', 3);\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Insert an enrollment record into the `Enrollments` table:**\n",
    "   ```sql\n",
    "   INSERT INTO Enrollments (EnrollmentID, StudentID, CourseID, EnrollmentDate)\n",
    "   VALUES (1, 1, 1, '2024-01-15');\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Foreign Key Violations:\n",
    "- If you try to insert a record into the `Enrollments` table with a `StudentID` that doesn't exist in the `Students` table, SQL will return an error:\n",
    "  ```sql\n",
    "  INSERT INTO Enrollments (EnrollmentID, StudentID, CourseID, EnrollmentDate)\n",
    "  VALUES (2, 999, 1, '2024-01-20');\n",

    "### **Summary of Primary Key and Foreign Key:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **PRIMARY KEY:**\n",
    "   - Ensures that each record in a table is unique.\n",
    "   - Cannot contain `NULL` values.\n",
    "   - There can only be one primary key in a table.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **FOREIGN KEY:**\n",
    "   - Ensures referential integrity by linking one table’s column to another table’s primary key.\n",
    "   - Can contain `NULL` values (unless restricted).\n",
    "   - You can have multiple foreign keys in a table.\n",
