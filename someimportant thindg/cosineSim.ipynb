    "**Recommendation Machine Learning** focuses on building models that suggest relevant items (e.g., products, movies, or content) to users based on their preferences, behaviors, or data patterns. It is widely used in e-commerce, streaming services, and social platforms.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Types of Recommendation Systems**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Content-Based Filtering**  \n",
    "   - Suggests items similar to what a user has interacted with based on item features (e.g., genre, keywords).  \n",
    "   - Example: Suggesting movies with the same genre as the ones a user watched.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Collaborative Filtering**  \n",
    "   - Suggests items based on user behavior patterns and preferences shared with similar users or items.\n",
    "   - **Types:**\n",
    "     - **User-Based**: Recommends based on similar user preferences.\n",
    "     - **Item-Based**: Recommends items frequently chosen together.\n",
    "   - Example: Netflix suggesting shows watched by users with similar preferences.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Hybrid Systems**  \n",
    "   - Combines multiple approaches (e.g., content-based + collaborative) for better accuracy.  \n",
    "   - Example: Amazon suggesting products using item features and user behaviors.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Knowledge-Based Recommendations**  \n",
    "   - Uses explicit user inputs and domain knowledge to make recommendations.\n",
    "   - Example: Travel websites recommending destinations based on user constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Context-Aware Recommendations**  \n",
    "   - Incorporates additional contextual information (e.g., time, location) for suggestions.\n",
    "   - Example: Suggesting warm clothes during winter.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Deep Learning-Based Systems**  \n",
    "   - Leverages neural networks to learn complex patterns from user-item interactions and features.\n",
    "   - Example: YouTube using deep models for personalized video recommendations.  \n",
    "\n",
    "These types can be tailored to specific use cases for optimal user engagement."

    "\n",
    "**Cosine Similarity** is a metric used to measure the similarity between two non-zero vectors in a multi-dimensional space. It calculates the cosine of the angle between the vectors, which indicates how closely they align.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Formula**\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{Cosine Similarity} = \\frac{\\mathbf{A} \\cdot \\mathbf{B}}{\\|\\mathbf{A}\\| \\|\\mathbf{B}\\|}\n",

    "- \\(+1\\): Vectors are identical (maximum similarity).  \n",
    "- \\(0\\): Vectors are orthogonal (no similarity).  \n",
    "- \\(-1\\): Vectors are opposite (rare in typical use cases where values are non-negative).\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Applications**\n",
    "1. **Text Similarity**  \n",
    "   - Compare document or sentence embeddings in Natural Language Processing (NLP).\n",

    "3. **Clustering**  \n",
    "   - Evaluate similarity in high-dimensional data.\n",
