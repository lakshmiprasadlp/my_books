The `train_test_split` function in **Scikit-learn** is used to split a dataset into two parts: one for training a machine learning model and the other for testing it. This ensures that the model's performance is evaluated on data it hasn't seen during training, providing a realistic estimate of its generalization ability.

### **Syntax**
```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.25, random_state=42, stratify=y)
```

### **Parameters**
1. **`X`**:
   - The feature set (input variables).
   - Usually a pandas DataFrame or a NumPy array.
2. **`y`**:
   - The target labels (output variable).
   - Can be a pandas Series or a NumPy array.

3. **`test_size`**:
   - Proportion of the dataset to include in the test split.
   - Value can be a float (e.g., `0.25` for 25% test data) or an integer (e.g., `100` rows for testing).
   - Default: `0.25` (if neither `test_size` nor `train_size` is specified).

4. **`train_size`**:
   - Proportion of the dataset to include in the training split.
   - Can also be a float or integer.
   - Default: Complement of `test_size`.

5. **`random_state`**:
   - A seed for random number generation to ensure reproducibility of the split.
   - E.g., `random_state=42` will give the same split every time you run it.

6. **`stratify`**:
   - Ensures that the split maintains the same proportion of target class labels as the original dataset.
   - Useful for imbalanced datasets.
   - Example: `stratify=y`.

### **Returns**
- **`X_train`**: Features for training.
- **`X_test`**: Features for testing.
- **`y_train`**: Labels for training.
- **`y_test`**: Labels for testing.

### **Example**
```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Sample dataset
X = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6], [7, 8], [9, 10]])
y = np.array([0, 1, 0, 1, 0])

# Splitting into training and test sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.4, random_state=42)

print("X_train:", X_train)
print("X_test:", X_test)
print("y_train:", y_train)
print("y_test:", y_test)
```

### **Output**
```
X_train: [[7 8]
          [1 2]
          [9 10]]
X_test:  [[3 4]
          [5 6]]
y_train: [1 0 0]
y_test:  [1 0]
```

### **Key Points**
1. **Random Splitting**:
   By default, the function splits the data randomly unless `random_state` is set.

2. **Stratified Splitting**:
   For classification tasks, especially when dealing with imbalanced classes, using `stratify=y` ensures that both training and test sets maintain the same class distribution.

3. **Reproducibility**:
   Using a `random_state` ensures consistent results when re-running the code.

### **Use Case in Machine Learning Workflow**
1. Load the dataset.
2. Split the data using `train_test_split`.
3. Train a model on `X_train` and `y_train`.
4. Test the model on `X_test` and evaluate its performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, etc.
